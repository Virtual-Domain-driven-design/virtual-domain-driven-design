      Some will say that you shouldn't even try to tackle a system bigger than what a typical agile team can absorb; others will say that agile just doesn’t scale beyond the simplest of systems. Experience suggests that reality lives somewhere between these two extremes, but where, exactly, is the clear and present question.

      In this talk, we’ll first consider the dimensions of scale - complexity, risk, and time - and then explore the ways that agility works (and sometimes doesn’t). Along, the way, we’ll study contemporary approaches to scaling agile, and conclude with an examination of work yet to be done.

      We will continue to pick up other approaches.

      Wardley Mapping is a great tool in the DDD practitioner toolkit. Use it to explore and define domains and bounded contexts, examine the implications of change, compare different strategic options, and design the team topologies needed to make them happen. But what are the most effective ways to use this highly effective tool in collaboration with others?

      There are several challenges with Wardley Mapping for collaboration and communication. What if people can't read or write maps? How far should you go to get an agreement on a map? And what about mapping that contradicts politics or authority? Join us for this hands-on session with Ben Mosior and Kenny Baas-Schwegler, where we will tour different ways of Wardley Mapping together and discuss their tradeoffs."

      * Testimonial injustice; When someone is ignored, or not believed, because of their sex, sexuality, gender presentation, race, or, broadly, because of their identity.
      * Hermeneutical injustice;  injustice related to how people interpret their lives.

      Join us in this session where Cat will do a short introduction on the topic, and after, we will talk about how this impact domain crunching. For instance, if we don't include software developers in requirements engineering, what is the impact? What if the software teams only allowed to build user stories and aren't part of the narrative for their building? And what about the exchange of narratives across the ecosystem, i.e. across domains. Do we have the hermeneutic resources to describe emergent behaviour across the system?

      "Domain-Driven Design is a lot about collaborative modelling, understanding the user's needs collaboratively to design and implement the best fitting model. We want the teams to do this as autonomous as possible, getting fast feedback and new insights into improving that model. At the same time, they need to stay aligned with the company goals and strategy and other teams. To ensure this alignment, companies hire managers and architects for that task. But what decisions should be made centralized, and what decentralized? What part of managing should be autocratic, and what should be participatory?

      Join us in a dialogue with Ellis de Haan, Marc Burgauer, Andrew Harmel-Law and Trond Hjorteland. We will discuss everything concerning the culture around autonomous teams. Patterns of anarchy, command and control decision making, architects as a job, the long going discussion of 'do we really need a manager' and can leaders be managers? And dive into the stratified systems theory or 'levels of work' by Elliot Jaques."

They need to surface, they need to continue delivering value to their customers, but sometimes it is not that straightforward.

      People wonder how distilling the Core with the Core, supportive and generic subdomains fit and what space. What concepts are in the problem space, and what is the solution? And what is a precise definition of problem and solution space?

      Join us in this session are a diverse group of people spanning multiple disciplines to look at how they see the relationship(s) between problem and solution space in IT.

      "There are many reasons to split up large-scale systems towards more modular, smaller services with their own model and language. You can decouple teams and give full autonomy of that service to a team. By decoupling services and teams you can handle changes to the domain faster, having a faster time to market. You decrease the cognitive load of the teams, empowering teams to truly understand the complexity of their shared models with domain experts.

      But how do we split up large-scale systems? What are the characteristics we can dissect a bounded context? How do we split towards a microservices architecture? We do not only have to deal with shifting terminology here but also different rates of change in the business.

      The recent COVID-19 pandemic forced us DDD practitioners to move our collaborative modelling efforts to the remote world. Within collaborative modelling, we want to share all the information we have, all the different perceptions, even if they might look weird, quirky or invalid at the start. Only then can we design and create enriched models to build sustainable and valuable software. The problem here is, people will only share all their information if there is psychological safety, and that is already hard in a physical session, let alone remote.

      In this session, we will have a dialogue with Gitte Klitgaard about the importance of psychological safety in these sessions. Why is it important and what are her heuristics and patterns for it in a remote session.

      Gitte Klitgaard is an agile coach with more than a decade of experience working for companies as well as coaching individuals. She lives and loves agile, and hates turf wars, which is why she took the oath of non-allegiance. Why fight over methods, when we can use that energy to help people? Gitte wants to change the world by helping people work better together and feel better about themselves. She is known for speaking her mind in a way that helps people actually listen to what she says; maybe because her main working tools are listening and caring. As an active part of the agile community, Gitte often engages in discussions online and offline, and is part of the organiser team of German Agile Coach Camp as well as a facilitator at other events.

      "Too many products have been developed that serve one kind of client only.
      The reason is that the composition of the teams leads (subconsciously) to the development of products that serve only people that resemble the people in the team.
      One “famous” example is the soap dispenser that only works if your skin is white.

      If teams are really cross-functional and are resembling the diversity of the market, the products they’re creating are also better.
      Thus, if the whole team has the full business expertise, knows the market, reflects the full diversity of the clients,
      then it can even disrupt the market and isn’t waiting for some person (e.g. the Product Owner) to decide on priorities.
      With this real cross-functionality, the team can fully understand the company’s business and has a holistic view of it, knowing its contribution to the company’s value stream.

      Join us in a Panel dialogue with Jutta Eckstein and Maryse Meinen about that
      real cross-functional teams are an essential building block for implementing company-wide agility and
      the organization benefits by creating better and in a way more real products and by having more options when entering the war of talent."

      "As Vladik Khononov says, minimising complexity in software systems is about balancing local vs global complexity. A major source of global complexity is the interaction between components in an architecture.
      In DDD, architectural components are bounded contexts and they interact using commands, queries, and events. While this is clear, the tools for modelling and visualising bounded context interaction are not so clear.
      In this hands-on meetup, we're going to explore different techniques that are used to design and visualise bounded context integration including:
      - UML Sequence Diagrams
      - Domain Storytelling
      - EventStorming
      - Domain Message Flow Modelling
      We will look at the pros & cons of each technique, and we will discuss ways to improve each technique. You will also have the chance to share other techniques you think are useful.
      The second part of this workshop will involve splitting into small groups and modelling a scenario using one or more of the discussed techniques."

      "Thanks to Krisztina we will have Matteo Collina as a special guest
      on our next panel. Matteo is a long time Nodejs contributor and TSC member. Open-source
      software is a success story, and undoubtedly one, we can learn from. In OSS the
      clocks tick differently, but it is software built for users, to solve problems
      - both relatively unknowns factors at the beginning. So what can DDD developers
      for businesses learn from that experience: how to handle these uncertainties,  how
      is the Ubiquitous Language developed in the Open source world? How do you do design
      in OSS? And many more questions!"

      'We are talking in DDD about Bounded Contexts and independent teams and applications,
      but then we all coupled by having the same user.' That statement led to an exciting
      dialogue by inviting Dawn: 'It is not so much coupling at the user as that sounds as
      if the user has to fit into what has built but starting with the user in the centre or
      intersection of the various 'contexts'. If your context no longer aligns with the user,
      who are you problem-solving/building the solution for?'
      Joining us with Krisztina, Jessica and Dawn will be Manuel from the Book team topologies,
      and together we will explore heuristics to organise teams, and their interaction and design
      bounded context for fast flow, which each serve the same customer."

But we don’t want to start building based on flawed design decisions, the consequences of which are hard/expensive to change when we discover it is faulty. The problem is, how do we balance these two polarities from an either-or to both-and thinking.
      In this session, we will explore contexts and tradeoffs in upfront design versus iterative design. Joining us to share their perspectives and experiences in a never-ending discussion are:

      Does the accountant understand the value of your work? The thinking and communication skills we've developed on the job often fail us when we face more-complex challenges.
      That is why we are learning DDD. Rather than double down on code-specific solutions, we are developing different, more effective conceptual approaches.
      Yet, there is an underlying skillset the nourishes and supports our ability to practice DDD or any approach that challenges traditional 'power' structures. In this workshop, we'll focus on that skillset.
      We'll explore the four fundamental truths:

      - Conway was right: communication architects software and systems

      - Uncertainty is always a factor

      - Fred Brooks was right: conceptual integrity matters most

      - Continuous learning is essential: the modern hero is the person who weaves everyone else's expertise into a cohesive, trustworthy whole

      And we'll explore four fundamental practices:

      - Argumentation: creating strong and valid solutions based on sound reasoning

      - Structuring collective reasoning: thinking well together

      - Recognizing conceptual fallacies

      - Cultivating the right types of energy: aka thoughts are only part of communication

      In this talk, I'll link to practice materials to try at home.

      "From Capabilities to Services: Modelling for business-IT alignment
      Service-orientation is still a surprisingly hard and complex endeavour after all these years and the risk of getting it wrong, potentially ending up with a distributed monolith with its devastating coupling, fragility, and cognitive nightmare, is still very real to many. Our industry is fairly immature and moves so fast that internalising acquired knowledge seems difficult and we often go through cycles of re-discovery of findings made decades ago. Maybe some SOA practitioners from the previous attempts made some breakthroughs that we have missed as we now have another go with microservices?

      The concept of business capabilities from business architecture can be one approach to take a closer look at, with its holistic outside-in perspective of the company. The capability vantage point inherently abstracts away the 'what' a company does from the 'how' , describing the essence of what the business offers. In this talk we will take a closer look at what they are and what they can help us with, all the way from business strategies and analysis, via organisational design to data management and technical design. They may just be the tool we need to design services, micro or not, holistically in a business aligned sociotechnical system, where people, information, processes, and technology defined by the business capability they supports."

      "The `traverse` function is so pervasive in functional programming that it became a joke:

      — How do I do— It's traverse

      https://twitter.com/search?q=%22it%27s%20traverse%22&src=typed_query

      Since it's a bit abstract until you actually encounter it, let's dig a little and review some case where… well, it was _actually_ `traverse`.

      - async calls
      - input validation
      - conditional execution
      - parsers generation
      - …

      In addition to making an elated crowd shout 'it's traverse', it will be a good occasion to learn more about what's an applicative functor and how it can be used.

      Examples will mostly be haskell, but we'll start with JS to ease into it more easily (someone once said that 67% of the NPM ecosystem could be replaced with `traverse`)."

      “95% of the words are spent extolling the benefits of ‘modularity’ and that little, if anything, is said about how to achieve it” - Glenford J. Myers, 1978.

      This quote is 40 years old. Tody, 4 decades later, nothing has changed except terminology. Time to change this. I want to talk about the various strategies of decomposing systems into modular components.

      You will learn what exactly Bounded Contexts and Microservices are, and what are the differences between the two notions. We will analyze what happens between services - how data flows, and how these flows can be optimized.

      Ultimately, we will explore different decomposition strategies and heuristics for designing modular systems - systems that aren’t driven by ever-changing fads, but by your business needs."

In this conference, I will introduce to you a solid approach - Aggregate Canvas. This Aggregate Canvas is created by KuoChao Chang, the co-organizer of DDD Taiwan Community. We would like to guide you to understand how to engage in a conversation with a team by a clear and complete mind to bring domain concepts into implementation, where a lot of elements mentioned in EventStorming are used to guide development teams through design."

      "When designing organizations for fast flow of change, we need to find effective boundaries between different streams of change. Techniques like Domain-Driven Design (DDD) are very powerful for this but can be quite involved and difficult to learn. A lightweight intermediate approach is to ask 'could this thing be run as a cloud-hosted (SaaS) service or product?'.

      This session explores the Independent Service Heuristics, a kind of “DDD-Lite” approach based on ideas in the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. The Independent Service Heuristics help teams to find candidate services and domains for running as a separate value stream or separate service.

      The Independent Service Heuristics have proven useful for various organizations improving flow. In this session, we would really welcome feedback and critique of the approach. Where might the approach not work? What pitfalls might there be? Are there questions or material missing?

      "Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) is a term that was coined by Dan North in 2006. It came about as a response to a very specific problem – teaching developers how to think about testing their code.
      It incorporates the ubiquitous language idea from Eric Evan’s book Domain-Driven Design, and this evolved into a technique used by the whole team to collaboratively specify how the finished system should behave.
      While both approaches focus on collaboration, DDD focuses on a shared model for building software and BDD focusses on specifying the behaviour of the system. So what can we learn from both our techniques?
      Join us in this session were Seb Rose, Steve Tooke and Matt Wynne will discuss with us how we can improve modelling with BDD. We will bust popular BDD myths and talk about their favourite collaboration techniques."

      "The power of collaborative modelling comes from having a diverse group of people who, together, have a lot of wisdom and knowledge.
      You would expect that all this knowledge will be put to use, co-creating, and to design a model. In reality, we don’t actually listen to all the available input and perspectives due to cognitive biases and ranking.
      Good modelling needs all the insights and perception to design the best one. If you are not aware, cognitive biases and ranking kills those insights and kills the effectiveness of your models!
      Join us in this session talking with Evelyn van Kelle and Romeu Moura about how awareness of your own cognitive biases and your ranking in the group can create more effective models!
      We will discuss how to use biases and ranking in your favour, making sure people are not excluded, and every knowledge is rally heard and put to good use in your models!"

      Join us with Thierry de Pauw in this Virtual DDD sessions to explore with us how feature branching can impact domain-driven design.
      Because one of the critical aspects of DDD is to keep gaining new insights together to create a rich and rigid domain model. For this, we need fast feedback which could be disabled by feature branching."

      Why? It can't just be because the Blue book is so thick? We're going to argue that the near enemies of DDD are to blame. Things which look like DDD, but which are in fact counterfeits that push us farther away from our goal.
      Join us with Gayathri and Andrew who will tell the story of a large-scale DDD implementation that got complicated. They'll talk about how took stock of the situation as they found it, how they identified where the root problems lay, how they set everyone off on a course of success, and the mistakes we made along the way.
      Regardless of whether you are working with serverless, microservices or a more monolithic architecture (nothing wrong there!) - this fun talk is for those who want to learn the lessons of implementing DDD at scale, with a healthy dose of pitfalls and hazards to watch out for too."

      "In this # VDDD meetup, we will talk with Ora Egozi-Barzilai and Evelyn van Kelle about their experience with socio-technical architecture. Socio-technical refers to the interrelatedness of social and technical aspects of an organization.
      Specific for this meetup we will discuss how teams affect the boundaries between bounded contexts and vice versa. These effects will give challenges in the way we design software architecture and organize teams around software to be highly aligned with business goals.
      Come join us, because together we can ask questions and discuss heuristics and patterns with Ora and Evelyn about socio-technical architecture!"

      "In this SPA conference special, we will talk with Trond Hjorteland about if business capabilities are useful in DDD.
      The DDD community seems to consist of mostly technical people, or at least with sort of hands-on programming experience, both now an back when the blue book was published. The decision to put the technical patterns at the start of that book was strategic (!) in that it was meant to invite the programmers in. As a consequence of that, it seems that most know very little about the enterprises' architecture space, and if they do, it seems to be with disdain for those dreaded ivory architects. And, for good reason in a lot of large waterfall-driven enterprises.

      My thesis is that by this approach we as a community is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, at least parts. There are things we ought to take a look at and incorporate into our toolbox, like architectural principles and business capabilities. The latter has been something I have had a special keen interest for, coming from the SOA space, and see a lot of parallels with the strategic patterns in DDD. I even believe it can be a great technique for getting started with discovering the problem space and even guide defining the bounded contexts.

      I would love to have a good discussion on this and maybe we all can gain new insights. That is always good, right?"

      "In this next virtual DDD meetup, João Rosa and Krisztina Hirth will discuss with us how impact mapping helps to find the possible solutions to achieve a measurable goal before you even know what to visualize.
      Also, how can you then combine it with other visualisation tools like EventStorming to guide your strategic design?

      In our industry, we have been assisting in digital transformations; the digital transformations have different labels, DevOps, Agile, Cloud, amongst others.
      However, most of these transformations just following a script, applying the same recipe everywhere. This approach has its merits, but also its pitfalls.

      To balance the change, visualisation techniques can be applied, aiding people, teams and organisations to manage the change and guide strategic design."

      "On this first SunDDDay 26th May at 16:30 Central European Time (Amsterdam GMT +2), virtual DDD meetup will hold an online panel discussion where you can ask questions!

      Marco Heimeshoff, and Kenny baas-Schwegler (with a possible attendance by Zsófia Herendi and Trond Hjorteland) will discuss their experience with EventStorming and User story mapping for domain discovery.

      The two main questions are:
      * How can we best combine User Story Mapping and EventStorming for domain discovery.
      * How can we go from EventStorming to user stories."

      I am also pleased to announce another great presenter Helin Akgul. She will be talking about DDD practices in TransferWise, and she will be giving examples around how they are using product engineering to create domain experts, and tips and tricks to adopting DDD practices gradually.
      I will post the abstract of her talk very soon."

      "Have you thought about that maybe all you know about patterns is just misconceptions?
      In this talk, Kevlin will take us to an alternative tour of patterns, one that is based on improving the habitability of code, communication, exploration, empiricism, reasoning, incremental development, sharing design and bridging rather than barricading different levels of expertise.
      Apparently, everyone knows about patterns. Except for those who don't. Which is basically all the people who've never come across patterns... plus many of the people who have.
      Singleton is often treated as a must-know pattern. Patterns are sometimes considered to be the basis of blueprint-driven architecture. Patterns are sometimes seen as a fixed set of ideas to apply within a school of thinking and practice, such as DDD. Patterns are also seen as something you don't need to know any more because you've got frameworks, libraries and middleware by the download. Or that patterns are something you don't need to know because you're building on diagrams, legacy code or emergent design. All these and more are misconceptions about patterns.
      Let's shift the focus from consuming patterns to recognising them, mining them and reasoning through them, with them and about them."
