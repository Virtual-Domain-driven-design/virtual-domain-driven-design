      It is not trivial to share knowledge about your systems with people on your team. Some sharing sessions try to it all at once, or be too long.
      In this talk we will go into detail on a technique called Bytesize Architecture Sessions. It addresses the problems mentioned above and gives you a lot more. The idea behind Bytesize Architecture Sessions is to have short meetings every 2~3 weeks with a well defined (modelling) goal. The participants of the meeting will have five minutes 'alone together' to focus on diagramming. After that, they will come to a consensus with a unified picture.
      The sessions have the following benefits:
        * It teaches the team to how to deliberately learn architecture in a safe environment
        * It helps with systems thinking
        * The resulting diagrams become a design tool that is inherently familiar to the team, since they created it.
        * It gives the team an homogeneous understanding of their systems
        * The resulting diagrams highlight areas for improvement.
