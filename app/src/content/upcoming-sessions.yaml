  #     There is a quote made famous by Ruth Malan from Grady Booch: 'Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system.' And shaping a system takes time, and seeing the impact of these significant design decisions can take years after the changes have been done. And most of us are usually not there to reak the benefit, or worse, feel its pain. So in collaboration with D-EDGE we will have a panel of people that did experience and will discuss how architecture decisions shaped the system years after the change.
