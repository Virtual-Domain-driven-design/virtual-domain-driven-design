  #     Writing a book about a modeling method (in our case: Domain Storytelling) necessarily makes you reflect on your own modeling practices. We had to frame things that we intuitively did in workshops. And we had to put our own approach into relation to other modeling methods. In this Meetup, we would like to talk about two concepts that came from these thoughts and discuss with you if they are applicable to collaborative modeling in general:

  #     Scope: Before a workshop, we try to figure out which kind of model is needed to make the workshop successful. This led to the concept of “scope”: Which point in time should we model? At which level of granularity should we model? Should we model the pure business process or how the software-supported process works?
  #     Scenario-based modeling: Several modeling methods that are popular with DDD practitioners are based on scenarios – meaning that one model shows only one case. Scenarios help a lot to learn and to deal with complexity. But they also raise the questions of which scenarios are relevant and how to keep an overview over many scenarios.
