     When building event-driven architectures, one of the challenges we face is coordinating work across many services. How do we implement complex data flows or complex business transactions that consist of multiple asynchronously executed steps? Luckily, there are patterns that can help us manage this complexity: orchestration and choreography. Join us in this fireside chat with Udi Dahan and Laila Bougria as we discuss how each pattern works, the pros and cons of each, and the trade-offs involved when choosing one over the other in specific contexts. See you there!

  #     This session focuses on how residuality theory is used in practice and will involve hands on work with matrices to test and validate architectures that participants are currently working on.
