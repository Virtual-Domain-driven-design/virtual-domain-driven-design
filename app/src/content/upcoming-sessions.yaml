      A Virtual Open Space Meetup on Technical Leadership and Collaborative Software Design
      
      As systemic complexity increases around us, many technologists are redefining “leadership.” What is technical leadership when good decision-making depends on collective, cross-functional thinking? How is collaborative modeling a form of leadership? What type of leadership does a systems architect provide?

      Join us on April 21st, 2023 for a virtual Open Space Meetup where we discuss these questions and more! We will explore strategies for providing integrative leadership. How do we work together to build complex systems that meet people’s real-world needs?

      Eb Ikonne, author of “Becoming a Leader in Product Development: An Evidence-Based Guide to the Essentials” will open the event with a keynote. Eb will create context for our discussions, describing adaptive leadership as something we can practice and a skill we can cultivate.

      As this is an Open Space, we will collectively create the day’s sessions and then join them! If you’ve never attended an Open Space, this organic process might seem chaotic or intimidating. We will be using gather.town to host the virtual open space, and soon we will publish a video that explains how it works. If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to the organizers on openspace@virtualddd.com. We are committed to creating a welcoming space where people feel confident sharing their ideas and experiences, even if they don’t consider themselves “experts”.

      Don't miss this opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals, share your experiences, and learn from each other about technical leadership and collaborative software design!
