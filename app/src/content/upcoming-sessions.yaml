      This session focuses on how residuality theory is used in practice and will involve hands on work with matrices to test and validate architectures that participants are currently working on.

      Complexity is inevitable. As our software solutions continue to evolve and expand, we need skills that enable us to deliver features, at scale, reliably. The challenge lies in understanding and building up skills to pivot from 'keep it simple' to 'work in complexity'.

      Let's explore this question together at our upcoming Virtual Domain-Driven Design Open Space Meetup on September 20th, 2023. Jessica Kerr, a renowned systems thinker, will kick off the event with a keynote.
